At last, the final game.
I think I know why you didn't wanted to stay as a ping pong ball.
You don't wanna live like the others, do you? That's why you're not giving up.
But what now? Even this game is a copy of others, just like the others. Shamless copy.
Dying, and dying, getting back up, suffering, just to reach this mere imitation of a game... Why?
I don't even know why this game even exist. Do you still want to continue?

Dang, it seems like the best manager of the month prize is no more.

In your game, you can always press ESC and Give Up.
Then I'll take you back to the ping pong game, then I'll be awarded with that best manager of the month thing, and you'll live the rest of your life in there, as a happy ball.
Sounds like a win-win to me.

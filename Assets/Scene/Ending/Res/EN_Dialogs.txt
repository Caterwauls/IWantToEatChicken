#바깥피막
We've reached the very most outer surface. Out of this one, lies no games anymore.
(...)
All the games we have passed so far, they're all shameless copies of other games.
And there are so many games like those out there.
That generic fancy graphics, those generic shooters, magic shooters...
They are not even new, what's the point on playing them?
What's the point of making them in the first place??

#모르겠어
(...)
I have no idea.
I have no idea why people put effort into making worlds like those,
and why people fight their way into those games...
Actually, I don't even know how one would make a completely new game.
(...)
I'll let you out of here.

#일이좋아
Nah, I love my job. I'm going back to the Ping Pong division.
Ping Pong management is in a severe labor shortage these days.

#돌아와
Come back if your mind change anytime.
After all, you eventually will come back.
